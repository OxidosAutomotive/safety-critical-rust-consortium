# Tooling Subcommittee

Hi there üëã

We're happy to have your interest in tooling for Rust deployed in safety-critical applications.

Thank you @PLeVasseur for the great template of a subcommittee.

## Subcommittee Role

The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium got kickstarted at [RustConf24](https://rustconf.com/) where we identified a need for several subcommittees to help organize initiatives around safety-critical Rust.

Tooling was one of the high interest topics that we have discussed, so the members decided to form a subcommitee for this.

## Subcommittee Mission Statement

A community-vetted minimal required tooling package to be able to certify Rust in safety-critical applications.
A document with a list of the minimal required tools and their development status. A possible curricula used for training in safety critical Rust (this is still te be determined of we need a different subcommittee for it).

Please see further details in our [mission statement](mission-statement.md).

## Members and Membership

Please find the list of members [here](members.md).

The Safety-Critical Rust Consortium is still working through what this process is. Please check back soon.

## Meetings

We are still sorting out meeting scheduling and frequency. Please check back soon.
